{{/*
Mutation config with a generated secret that specifies a certificate and key signed by a certificate authority.
The certificate authority is configured in the mutating webhook configuration so that the API server can setup
a secure connection to the mutating admission webhook.

Helm generates the secret only once and stores ca.crt tls.crt, and tls.key in this secret.
Upon upgrades the values from this secret are used. This guarantees minimal downtime. If the certificate
would be generated every time, then upon upgrade, the mutating webhook configuration would be temporarily
inconsistent with the certificate used by the webhook so that deploys would fail for a short amount of time.

To achieve this behavior, the Secret is generated using a pre-install, pre-upgrade hook. The pre-upgrade hook is used
to deal with cases where the secret was deleted manually. When the secret already exists, the certificates from the
secret are reused and the secret is not generated. Deletion of the secret is then prevented by the 'keep'
resouce-policy of helm. This also means that the secret will remain if the chart is uninstalled.

See https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/crypto.html for docs on the cryptographic functions in Helm.
